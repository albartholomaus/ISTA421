1. ####	There are many kinds of tests, including Unit Tests. What is a unit test, and what does it enable you to do?

- *Each Assert method allows different types of comparison to be made and throws an exception if the result
is not what was expected.*
---
4. #### The book states: “[T]he chain of dependencies can make it difficult to understand what causes a test to fail.” Why is this statement true?

---
10. ####	What is a mocking framework? What is the difference between a fake object and a mock object?
- *mocking framework makes it easier to create fake components to
isolate parts of the application for unit testing..*
